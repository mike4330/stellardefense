## üéÆ Game Architecture

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main game file with core game loop
- `visual_effects.js` - Rendering engine and visual effects
- `sound.js` - Audio system and sound effects
- `level_config.js` - Level definitions and configurations
- `high_scores.js` - High score management
- `styles.css` - Game styling and UI

### Key Systems
- **Game Loop**: Main update/render cycle in `index.html`
- **Entity System**: Player, enemies, bullets management
- **Collision Detection**: Rectangular and circular collision
- **Spawn System**: Time-based enemy spawning
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API sound generation
- **Visual Engine**: Canvas rendering with effects
